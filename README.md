# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository, where I showcase a variety of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** projects. These projects were developed using popular frameworks like **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch**, solving real-world problems with datasets from sources such as **Kaggle**.

## Introduction
This repository features multiple projects demonstrating my skills in **classification**, **regression**, and **neural networks**. Each project is organized with clear documentation, code explanations, and results.

The projects aim to:
- Showcase proficiency in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** frameworks.
- Solve real-world problems using structured and unstructured data.
- Highlight best practices in model training, tuning, and evaluation.

## Technologies
The projects in this repository utilize the following technologies:
- **Scikit-learn**: For classical machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **PyTorch**: For flexible deep learning model implementations.
- **Python**: For general programming and data manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive coding and project explanations.

## Project structure
Each project will be contained within its own directory:
```css
/ML-DL-Projects
   ├── Project1
   ├── Project2
   ├── Project3
   └── ...
```

Inside each folder, you'll find the corresponding code, dataset links, and a README.md for project-specific details.
